# Prediction of demand for bike rentals using regression models

- Built and trained ***regression models*** with ***sckit-learn*** on the ***Capital Bike Share (Washington, D.C.) Kaggle*** dataset, in order to predict ***demand for bicycle rentals*** at any given hour, based on time and weather
- Project comprised ***all phases of machine learning workflow*** (e.g., train-test-splitting the data, exploratory data analysis, iteratively optimizing the models by expanding or selecting features (using pipelines), regularizing models to avoid overfitting, optimization of hyperparameters,evaluating models for train and test data based on RMSLE)
